Implementation of various AI algorithms

## Reinforcement Learning

### Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd ed, 2018) by Sutton and Barto

Implementation of selected algorithms from the book. I tried to make code minimalistic and as close to the book as possible.

Part I: Tabular Solution Methods
* Sections 2.1-2.4: [Simple Bandit Algorithm](RL_An_Introduction_2018/0204_Simple_Bandit.html) (includes figures 2.1, 2.2)
